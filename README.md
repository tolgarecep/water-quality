Here, I analyzed water samples and built a model to predict their potability.

Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy

Upcoming:
- Updates on hyper-parameter tuning
- Updates on feature engineering

Development notes:
- Reducing 'Solids' and 'Conductivity' features' skewness caused SVM performance to reduce drastically, so it's removed from the feature engineering.
