Here, I analyzed water samples and built a model to predict their potability.

Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy

Upcoming:
- Final evaluation
- Updates on hyper-parameter tuning
- Updates on feature engineering

Notes:
- There are some preprocessing errors, will be fixed shortly
